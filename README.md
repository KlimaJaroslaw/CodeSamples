# Code Samples

## Short Description
Below I share code samples written by me, from projects I worked on either with team **(company project)** or by myself **(personal)**. Each code sample is presented using a markdown file where I describe the logic and the idea behind the code and I also include a link to a raw script file.

I grouped code by projects:

## 1. ShipIt :sailboat: - Game (Personal)
Game project (currently in development) powered by Unity Engine. Featuring fundamental gameplay mechanics including among other things: ability tree management.
